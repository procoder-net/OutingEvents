-> PostGres setup
https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
Install postgres, it will ask you to go through the installation process and will ask for a super user password. Make sure you remember that password as it will be useful.

Use the following command to open a commandline interface:

```
psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432
```

Execute the following queries to create database:

```
CREATE DATABASE outingevents
```

We will come back to editing the database, but first in .bash_profile, include the following:

```
PGUSER={your postgres user}
PGDATABASE=outingevents
PGPASSWORD={super user password}
```

You can also define port and host, but those are 5432 and localhost by default.

NOTE: You can continue using the command line, or psequel for a GUI: http://www.psequel.com/
Psequel will ask for your username, password, database, port, host.
Execute the following commands to create the relevant table(s):

```
$ psql -f sql/createtables.sql
```

It will create the tables if they exist.
Test the apis by calling the following:

```
POST https://localhost:3000/event
GET https://localhost:3000/event
```

You should get back elements in the database.

To display the Survey Results Bar Charts, you need to install Chartkick:
